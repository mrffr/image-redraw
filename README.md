# Image Redraw

This program takes an input image and attempts to redraw the image using some basic shapes. 

Usage:
```
redraw [-n iterations] [-f draw_function] input_image output_image
        -f <line, box, ellipse, scatter, wu_line, tri, poly, rand>
```

The example below shows the result of asking the program to redraw the first photograph using only ellipses and a few million iterations.
